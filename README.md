# Introduction
This case study was initially completed using an example of the titanic data analysis to learn about python and pandas. After careful consideration, the titanic analysis left a great deal to be desired. To supplement that, it will be replaced with a custom case study on gun violence in the U.S 2022.

## Case Study 2 Revised
With subject lenses, I had notice there were more news articles on gun violence incident of late and was curious of what was going on. I mentioned the curiosity to my wife and she sent me a link of incidents for a since month that a website had aggregated. There were 22 incidences within that one month and I thought there was no way it could have been that much. After review the data, I saw the website had attached a link to every article to reference that incident. To feed my curiosity, I decided to download the gun violence data from a government website and perform my own analysis to see the trend. I plan to use mySQL for aggregate and analyze the data and Tableau for visualization.

The final goal is to aggregate 10 years worth of data and track the trend over the years. I would also like to expand the data is investigate how does population and population density affect the data. I considered diving more and investigate into education, diversity and psychological factors. This case study will be a comprehensive case study and will evolve over time. Potentially, I would like to create a predictive model to estimate the number of gun violence for the following year and where it is likely to occur.
